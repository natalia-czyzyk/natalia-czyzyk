## Hi everyone!

My name is **Natalia CzyÅ¼yk** and I'm a **Data Analyst** specializing in **Sales and Customer Data analytics and automation**. I have a Master's in Business Intelligence and 4+ years of experience in tech.

My skills are in **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, **Tableau**, and **Data Analysis**.
Some of my projects:

ðŸŒ± Agent-based analysis of consumer preferences in the introduction of novel sustainable cosmetics (**Python** **+** **NetLogo**)

âš¡  Averaging predictive distributions across calibration windows for day-ahead electricity prices (**Python**)

ðŸ“Š Reading habits in the EU â€“ data analysis & visualisation (**Tableau**)

I'm looking to extend my skills and knowledge.

Outside of work, I love cats, practicing yoga, and reading books with hopes of writing my own one day.
