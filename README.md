## Hi everyone!

My name is **Natalia Czyżyk** and I'm a **Data Analyst** specializing in **Sales and Customer Data analytics and automation**. I have a Master's in Business Intelligence and 4+ years of experience in tech.

My skills are in **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, **Tableau**, and **Data Analysis**. I'm currently learning **PowerBI** and **Machine Learning**.

Some of my projects:

🌱 Agent-based analysis of consumer preferences in the introduction of novel sustainable cosmetics (**Python** **+** **NetLogo**)

⚡  Averaging predictive distributions across calibration windows for day-ahead electricity prices (**Python**)

🚶 Analysis of crossing pedestrian paths (**Python**)

I'm looking to extend my skills and knowledge.

Outside of work, I love cats 🐾, practicing yoga 🧘, and reading novels 📖 — with hopes of writing my own one day.
